Por Coru&ntilde;a for the Nokia N9
===========================

What is it?
-----------

Por Coru&ntilde;a is a public transportation application for the [Nokia N9][0]. It
currently provides information about [A Coru&ntilde;a][1]'s bus lines, bus stops
and bus arrival times, allowing users to save their favorite bus stops.

How does it work?
-----------------

Por Coru&ntilde;a is happily using [M&oacute;vete][2]'s API. [M&oacute;vete][2] has been
developed by [V&iacute;ctor Pena][3], who has also provided an iOS
implementation, already available in the [App Store][4].

Por Coru&ntilde;a has been developed with the hope of being useful, but for sure
things can be improved. If you find bugs or have any ideas to make it
